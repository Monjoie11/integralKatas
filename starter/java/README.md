#Integral Social Networking Kata

###This application has been updated to a newer version of Gradle to accomodate incluson of Spring Boot 2.0

My approach will be to:

1) Stub a repo that satisfies Feature:Publishing
2) Implement service satisfying ""
3) Expose Controller satisfying ""

I will be using Test Driven *Design*

I will create empty classes, then failing test, then implement necessary code for test to pass, then refactor, then add a faiiling test of the next functionality, then repeat

I am making my init commit a 5:00pm mdt
